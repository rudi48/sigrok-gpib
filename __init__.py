'''
This protocol decoder can decode synchronous parallel buses with various
number of data bits/channels and one (optional) clock line.

If no clock line is supplied, the decoder works slightly differently in
that it interprets every transition on any of the supplied data channels
like there had been a clock transition.

It is required to use the lowest data channels, and use consecutive ones.
For example, for a 4-bit sync parallel bus, channels D0/D1/D2/D3 (and CLK)
should be used. Using combinations like D7/D12/D3/D15 is not supported.
For an 8-bit bus you should use D0-D7, for a 16-bit bus use D0-D15 and so on.

If the clock pin is set, GPIB decoding is shown.

If the total sample number is given, the last byte is shown.
